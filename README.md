### What is a CTF
> src: wikipedia<br>
In computer security, Capture the Flag (CTF), a type of wargame, is a computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world (i.e., bug bounty programs in professional settings). Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which have been required by prior CTF contests at DEF CON. There are three main styles of capture the flag competitions: attack/defense, hardware challenges and jeopardy. <br>
